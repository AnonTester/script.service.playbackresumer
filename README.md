# script.service.playbackresumer

A simple addon to periodically update the resume point of the currently playing video automatically in the background, so that playback progess is not lost in the event of a Kodi crash.

Optionally atuomatically resume playback automatically when xbmc is restarted after a crash, or trigger playback of a random video.

Original code by Bradvido recovered from the main Kodi forum thread on this, and (for now at least) updated maintained in this repo by bossanova808.
